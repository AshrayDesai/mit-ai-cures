MIT AI Cures is a project wherein many data scientists attempt to use machine learning to solve medical problems such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is my experimentation with machine learning models on data from the AI Cures database. Currently, I have trained and tested an XGBoost gradient-boosting machine learning model on a dataset of SMILES molecule representations to predict whether or not new molecules will be able to bind to and disable sars-cov-2, the novel coronavirus behind the disease COVID-19.
